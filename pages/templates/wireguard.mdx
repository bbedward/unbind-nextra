## Notable Variables

| Variable Name | Service Name | Description |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| `INIT_USERNAME` | WireGuard | The username to login to the WireGuard admin panel |
| `INIT_PASSWORD` | WireGuard | The password to login to the WireGuard admin panel |

## Accessing your WireGuard Admin UI

1. Visit the URL of the `WireGuard` service
2. Login with the credentials from the `Variables` section of the `WireGuard` service

## Connecting to WireGuard

WireGuard creates a UDP [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) service on a randomly chosen port in the range of 30000-32767.

You can find out what the Port is in the `INIT_PORT` variable of the WireGuard service.

The WireGuard user interface will already be aware of your server's IP and the port so when you export the configurations, it should already be configured correctly.
