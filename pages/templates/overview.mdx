# Templates Overview

Unbind has a built-in templating system that can compose multiple services together, for example deploying a stack that requires a database, a web server, and a queue.

You can think of templates like [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files or [helm charts](https://helm.sh/) - but they compose services on Unbind.

## What are Templates?

Templates are a way to compose multiple services together, and deploy them as a single unit.
- **Databases** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- **Docker Images** - Any docker image can be part of a template
- **Inputs** - Templates can have inputs, which are determined by the user at deploy-time.
- **Volumes** - Volumes can be attached to services as part of a template.
- **Variables** - Variables can be configured on template services, and can be auto-generated using a set of generators (such as a password generator).
- **Variable References** - Template services can reference variables from other services within the same template (such as referencing the database credentials)

## How to Deploy a Template

When you create a new service, simply choose the **Template** option and select the template you want to deploy.

## Post-install

Many templates are straight forward, and have a guided setup when you visit the URL of the service for the first time.

Some templates do not and store default credentials in the `Variables` section of the service. See the specific post-install pages for instructions regarding certain templates.
