# Open Source & Free
<Callout>
Unbind is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-api/blob/main/LICENSE).
</Callout>

At Unbind, we believe in the power of open source software to create better, more transparent, and more accessible solutions for everyone.

**Code** is only a part of it, we believe in building a community and fostering innovation that benefits all.

## Our Open Source Philosophy

**Transparency First**  
We believe that software should be transparent and auditable. When you can see how something works, you can trust it, improve it, and adapt it to your needs.

**Community-Driven Innovation**  
The best solutions come from diverse perspectives and collaborative effort. By open sourcing our work, we invite developers, designers, and users from around the world to contribute to build a better platform.

**Freedom to Modify**  
Your tools should work for you, not the other way around. Open source gives you the freedom to modify, extend, and customize software to fit your specific business requirements.

## What We Open Source

**Core Libraries & Tools**  
All of our core components are open source and MIT licensed, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/unbindapp).

**Documentation & Guides**  
We maintain a commitment to consistently improve documentation and instructional information.

**Reference Implementations**  
We provide reference implementations and examples that demonstrate best practices and help accelerate your development process.

</Callout>

We pledge to maintain our open source projects with the same care and attention as any potential commercial offering. This means:

- Regular updates and security patches
- Responsive community engagement
- Clear roadmaps and transparent decision-making
