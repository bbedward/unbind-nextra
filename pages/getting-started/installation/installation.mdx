import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Quickstart

{/* Box with curl command idk, html maybe */}

Unbind's installation process is fully self-guided, and will install all pre-requisites for you. There is no need to install anything manually before starting the installation - it is actually recommended that you don't.

The primary input required for the installation is your domain name, you can get extra details on how to set up your domain name in the [DNS Setup](./dns) section.

<Callout type="info">
It's recommended to start fresh, on a new server to avoid any potential conflicts or resource contention with existing software.
