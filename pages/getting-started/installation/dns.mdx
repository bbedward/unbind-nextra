## DNS Setup
Unbind requires a domain name (or subdomain) to be setup before installation.

For this example, we are going to use:
- `unbind.app` as the domain that we own.
- `unbind.unbind.app` as the domain that we will use to access our Unbind instance.
- `unbind-registry.unbind.app` as the domain that we will use for our container registry.

### DNS options
You have a two options for setting up DNS for Unbind:
1. **Wildcard DNS**: This is the recommended option for the best experience.
2. **No Wildcard DNS**: You will only lose the automatic domain generation feature of Unbind, but you can still manually create DNS records for each application you deploy.

### Primary DNS
For the best experience, it is recommended to configure a wildcard DNS record for Unbind. This will allow Unbind to automatically generate routes for all of your applications without any additional DNS configuration.


**Wildcard DNS Example**

For our example domain, we are going to create an **A** record for `*.unbind.app` pointing to the public IP address of our Unbind server.

**Other providers:**
Most DNS providers have a similar interface for creating DNS records - not all support Wildcard DNS, if you need help please join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/unbind) and ask for assistance!

Squarespace does not support wildcard DNS records, but you can still proceed without wildcard DNS

**Normal DNS Example**

For our example domain, we are going to create an **A** record for `unbind.unbind.app` pointing to the public IP address of our Unbind server.

**Other providers:**
The process is the exact same as described above, just create an **A** record for `unbind.unbind.app` pointing to the public IP address of your Unbind server.


### Registry DNS
For our example domain, we are going to create an **A** record for `unbind-registry.unbind.app` pointing to the public IP address of our Unbind server.

**Cloudflare Example:**

<Callout type="info">
You can also omit the internal registry and use any public registry such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Quay.io](https://quay.io/), or [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) - just choose the option in the installer when prompted.

### Final Steps
The installer will validate that your DNS records are set up correctly before proceeding with the installation. If you have any issues, please double-check your DNS records and ensure they are pointing to the correct IP address.
