## Unbind Concepts
Unbind has a few key concepts that are important to understand in order to fully understand how to use Unbind effectively.

{/* Team->Project->Env->{Group}->Service hierarchy image ? */}

### Team
A **Team** is at the highest level of the Unbind hierarchy. It encompasses *Projects*, *Environments*, and *Services*.

- **Kubernetes namespace**: Each team is associated with a Kubernetes namespace, which is used to isolate resources within the cluster.
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Team permissions are translated directly into kubernetes [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) rules, meaning permission enforcement is also happening at the cluster level.

Within one team, you can create multiple **Projects**.

### Project
A **Project** is a collection of **Environments** and therefore **Services**. It is a logical grouping of resources that are related to a specific application or service.

- **Kubernetes label**: Each project is associated with a Kubernetes label, which is used to group resources within the cluster.
- **Permission enforcement**: Despite teams directly linked to Kubernetes RBAC, permissions are still configurable and enforceable at the project level.
  - This means  you could have a user that has access to a team, but only has access to specific projects within that team.

Within one project, you can create multiple **Environments**.

### Environment
An **Environment** is a the last level of the Unbind hierarchy. It is a logical grouping of **Services** that are related to a specific environment, such as development, staging, or production.

- **Kubernetes label**: Each environment is associated with a Kubernetes label, which is used to group resources within the cluster.
- **Permission enforcement**: Permissions are also configurable and enforceable at the environment level.
  - This means you could have a user that has access to a team and project, but only has access to specific environments within that project.

Within one environment, you can create multiple **Services**.

### Service
A **Service** is a single application or service that is deployed within an environment. It can be a web application, database, or any other type of service that you want to deploy.

- **Kubernetes label**: All resources associated with a service are labeled with the service, environment, project, and team IDs.
  - At the low level, this means that we can logically group logs and metrics for a service, environment, project, or team.
- **Kubernetes resource**: Each service is associated with at least one, but often more Kubernetes resources, such as a Deployment, StatefulSet, Job, Ingress, etc.

### Instance
An **instance** is a specific running container (pod) of a service.

- **Replicas**: Most of the time, the number of instances will be equal to the number of replicas defined in the service configuration.
  - This is the case for stateless services, such as web applications or APIs.
  - Some databases will have multiple instances serving different roles, such as a read-replica of a database.
- **Load balancing**: Your traffic will be automatically load balanced across all instances of a service.

### Variable
A **Variable** is a synonym for a [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). They directly correlate to environment variables within each **instance**.

- **Build time**: All variables are also injected at build time, meaning that they are available to the application during the build process.
- **Runtime**: Variables are also injected at runtime, meaning that they are available to the application during execution.
- **Scope**: Variables can be scoped to a service, environment, project, or team.
  - **Team**: Variables scoped to a team, are available to be referenced by any service within that team.
  - **Project**: Variables scoped to a project, are available to be referenced by any service within that project.
  - **Environment**: Variables scoped to an environment, are available to be referenced by any service within that environment.
  - **Service**: Variables scoped to a service, are available to be referenced by other services within that environment.
- **References**: Variables can be references of other variables, or service endpoints. Just use `$` to list all available references when creating a variable.
  - **Auto syncing**: Referenced variables update everywhere. If Service A is referencing `${Service B.DATABASE_PASSWORD}` - and you update the password for Service B, it will automatically trigger a redeployment of Service A with the new password.
  - **Composition**: You can compose variables with plaintext and as many references as you want. For example, `pg://user:${Service B.DATABASE_PASSWORD}@${Service B.DATABASE_HOST}:${Service B.DATABASE_PORT}/${Service B.DATABASE_NAME}`.
