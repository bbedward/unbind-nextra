## Creating the First user
After the installation is complete, you can navigate in any web browser to your Unbind installation URL. For our example, it was `https://unbind.unbind.app`.

You will be greeted with a screen to create your first user and password.

Afterwards, you'll be automatically logged in and ready to deploy your first application!

<Callout type="info">
The first user you create will be a "superuser" with full access to all Unbind resources.
