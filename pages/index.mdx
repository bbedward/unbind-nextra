## What is Unbind?

Unbind is an open-source, self-hosted Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that gives you the simplicity of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Railway](https://railway.com/) backed by the power of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

### Simplicity

Just bring a server and a domain name, and in minutes you'll be able to deploy all of your applications, databases, docker images, and many prebuild templates including [n8n](https://n8n.io), [Supabase](https://supabase.com), [Plausible](https://plausible.io), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com), and more.

No need for Dockerfiles, YAML, complex networking configurations, or TLS. It's all taken care of for you seamlessly out of the box.

### Scalability

From a single server to hundreds of servers, Unbind will scale with you. With Kubernetes, you can easily add or remove compute resources, configure high availability for storage and networking, and ensure your applications remain resilient and performant as your needs grow.

### Backups

Easily configure backups to any S3-compatible storage provider, including [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/), [MinIO](https://min.io/), and more.

### Security

Unbind seamlessly integrates user permissions with [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), so you can control who can access what in your cluster.

### Open Source

Unbind and all of its components are open source, MIT-licensed, and all source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/unbindapp).
