# Adding Servers

1. Create a new server that meets the [system requirements](/installing#server-requirements)
2. On your existing server run the following command:
```bash copy
unbind add-node
```
This will output a command that looks like:
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.33.1+k3s1 K3S_URL=https://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<SECRET_JOIN_TOKEN> sh -
```
3. Copy the command and run it on the new server.

## Verifying the Node joined.

Run the following command on your primary server to check if the node joined successfully:
```bash copy
kubectl get nodes
```

## Removing a node

<Callout type="warning">
If you are using longhorn, removing a node will delete all data from the node, including any persistent volumes. To avoid data loss, longhorn *must* be configured with at least 3 replicas - or you must migrate all data to another node before removing the node.
</Callout>

1. Cordon the node you intend to remove, this will prevent new workloads from being scheduled to it.
```bash copy
kubectl cordon <node-name>
```
2. Drain the node, this will gracefully move all workloads to other nodes.
```bash copy
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
```
3. Delete the node.
```bash copy
kubectl delete node <node-name>
```
4. Verify the node is removed.
```bash copy
kubectl get nodes
```

You are free to repurpose or delete the server as you see fit.

## High Availability

<Callout type="warning">
This section is a **work in progress** and just gives a general overview of how to achieve high availability.
</Callout>

For a high availability k3s cluster, generally you will need to configure the following:
- An **odd** number of *control plane* servers.
- Control planes need to use `etcd`, for k3s this is a matter of adding `--cluster-init` to `/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service` and restarting the service with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart k3s`
- It's ideal to configure an external load balancer, many cloud providers offer load balancers as a service.
- It's ideal to **not** schedule normal workloads on the control plane servers, and instead use a separate set of servers for that.
  - You can use [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) to prevent workloads from being scheduled to the control plane servers.
- If using [longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) (Unbind's default storage class) - it's ideal to increase the number of replicas to 3 or more to prevent data loss in the event of a total system failure.
