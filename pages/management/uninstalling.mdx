# Uninstalling Unbind

If you need to completely remove Unbind from your server, this guide will walk you through the proper uninstallation process.

<Callout type="warning">
**Data Loss Warning**: Uninstalling Unbind will permanently delete all applications, data, and configurations. Make sure to backup any important data before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Uninstallation Methods

### Method 1: Unbind Script (Recommended)

This method removes Unbind, K3S, and all associated data:

```bash copy
unbind uninstall
```

<Callout type="info">
This is the recommended method as it ensures complete cleanup of all Kubernetes components, such as Longhorn.
</Callout>

### Method 2: Uninstall k3s directly

This is not recommended as it may leave some data behind.

```bash copy
# Run k3s uninstaller
sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```

### (Advanced) Selectively remove components from k3s

<Callout type="warning">
This will likely break your Unbind installation, proceed at your own risk.
</Callout>

You can use [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to remove specific components while keeping others.

To list all components installed by Unbind
```bash copy
helm list -n unbind-system
```

To remove a specific component
```bash copy
helm uninstall <component-name> -n unbind-system
```

## DNS and SSL Cleanup

### Remove DNS Records

<Callout type="warning">
When you tear down a server, cloud providers will re-use your IP address. It is important to remove your DNS records so they don't unintentionally resolve to someone else's server.
</Callout>

1. **Remove A records** for your Unbind domain
2. **Remove wildcard DNS** records if configured
3. **Remove registry DNS** records

## Verification

After uninstallation, verify everything is removed:

### Check Running Processes

```bash copy
# Check for any remaining K3S processes
ps aux | grep k3s

# Check for container runtime processes
ps aux | grep containerd
```

### Check Network Interfaces

```bash copy
# List network interfaces
ip link show

# Should not see flannel.1, cni0, or other K3S interfaces
```

### Check Mounted Filesystems

```bash copy
# Check for any remaining K3S mounts
mount | grep k3s
mount | grep longhorn
```

### Check System Services

```bash copy
# Verify K3S services are removed
sudo systemctl list-units | grep k3s
```

### Reboot the Server
It's a good idea to reboot the server after uninstalling to ensure all services are stopped and resources are freed up.

```bash copy
sudo reboot
```
