# Architecture Overview

Unbind is built as a collection of services that work together to provide a complete Kubernetes platform. The architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Core Services

<Callout>
Unbind is built as an *extension* of **Kubernetes**, therefore it is not possible to use Unbind without Kubernetes.
</Callout>

These are the primary services developed and maintained by the Unbind team:

| Service | Language | Repository | Description |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Unbind API** | Go | [unbind-api](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-api) | Core API server that handles all business logic, user management, and orchestrates deployments |
| **Unbind UI** | Next.js | [unbind-ui](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-ui) | Modern web interface providing the complete user experience for managing applications |
| **Unbind Builder** | Go | [unbind-api](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-api) | Build service responsible for creating container images from source code |
| **Unbind Operator** | Go | [unbind-operator](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-operator) | Kubernetes operator that manages application deployments and lifecycle |
| **Unbind OIDC Server** | Go | [unbind-api](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-api) | OpenID Connect server for secure authentication and authorization |

## Third-Party Dependencies

Unbind leverages several best-in-class open source projects to provide robust functionality:

### Authentication & Security
| Component | Purpose | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **[Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex)** | OIDC Identity Provider | Handles user authentication and integrates with external identity providers |
| **[kube-oidc-proxy](https://github.com/unbindapp/kube-oidc-proxy)** | Kubernetes Auth Proxy | Securely authenticates users to the Kubernetes API server using OIDC tokens |

### Build System
| Component | Purpose | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **[Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)** | Container Build Engine | High-performance, cache-efficient container image builder |
| **[Railpack](https://railpack.com)** | Build Plan Generator | Automatically analyzes source code and generates optimized build configurations |

### Observability & Logging
| Component | Purpose | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **[Alloy](https://grafana.com/oss/alloy-opentelemetry-collector/)** | Log Collection | Collects and aggregates container logs from across the platform |
| **[Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/)** | Log Storage | Horizontally scalable log storage with powerful query capabilities |

### Data Storage
| Component | Purpose | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** | Primary Database | Stores all application metadata, user data, and deployment configurations |
| **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** | Cache & Queue | Handles build queues, session storage, and general purpose caching |

## Architecture Principles

- **Microservices**: Each component has limited responsibilities and can be scaled independently
- **Cloud Native**: Built for Kubernetes with cloud-native patterns and practices
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection across all services
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows for easily adding new integrations and customizing the platform to your needs.
