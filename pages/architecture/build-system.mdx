# Build System

## Unbind Builder
<Callout>
All "builds" are done with [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) and pushed to the container registry configured during installation.
</Callout>

The [Unbind builder](https://github.com/unbindapp/unbind-api) is a container that is spawned independently as a [kubernetes job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) when a deployment is needed.

It has several capabilities and responsibilities in the build and deployment process.
1) It can build your application using [Railpack](https://railpack.com)
  - Railpack is essentially responsible for generating a "Dockerfile" for your application so you don't have to.
2) It builds applications using [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
3) It translates the build inputs and outputs into an Unbind [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
4) It deploys the CRD to the cluster, which is then processed by the [Unbind Operator](/architecture/operator)
5) For services that do not need build, such as prebuild docker images or databases - the build step is simply bypassed, but the CRD is still created.

## Buildkit

[Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) is a container build system that is used to build applications.

It is used to build applications using [Railpack](https://railpack.com) and push the resulting image to the container registry.

We use a rootless buildkit daemon, which is deployed to your cluster after installing Unbind automatically.

<Callout>
This Documentation is a **work in progress**, but you are able to configure the buildkit daemon to have higher concurrency, scale it up to multiple servers, and even restrict it to only run on specific servers.
</Callout>

## Build Caching

The builder will automatically create a build cache for your applications, which is stored on your container registry and used to speed up subsequent builds.

## Railpack

[Railpack](https://railpack.com) is a tool created by [Railway](https://railway.app/) that is used to generate a Dockerfile for your application.

It is the default builder when you create a new Service in Unbind.
