After successfully installing Unbind and configuring DNS, you'll need to create your first user account to access the Unbind dashboard.

## Access the Dashboard

Navigate to your Unbind domain in a web browser:

```
https://yourdomain.com
```

On a new installation, you will be prompted to create your first user.

<Callout type="info">
The first user will be a superuser/admin account with full privileges and access to all resources.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

With your first user created, you're ready to start using Unbind! Check out [What's Next](/post-installation/whatsnext) to learn about deploying your first application.
